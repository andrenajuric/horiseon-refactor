HORISEON ACCESSIBILITY CODE REFACTOR:

-- MAIN TASK --

I made changes to horiseon's marketing site and pushed semantic elements to the HTML code to make it more accessible. I reworked it so that the website will receive a higher ranking in search engine result pages, which will ultimately lead to more clicks to their site.
 
I added alt attributes to every image that would read a description aloud to someone who is sight-impaired. It was difficult trying to describe exactly what I was seeing in a way that I think would make sense to someone who can't see it for themselves. I tried to describe each image in a very literal sense - e.g. "a symbol of a human body witha lightbulb for a head" when representing visibility for Horiseon's business.

I consolidated certain sections and classes that were able in order to make the code cleaner and more structurally sound; and tried to leave good comments in the HTML + CSS files so that anyone who views it after me would see exactly what each line of code does, and would be able to see my thought process. I also made sure all the links functioned correctly (placeholders for now).
